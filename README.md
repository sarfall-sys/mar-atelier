## 📊 Catalog Data
The catalog section uses data stored in a **JSON file**, which is imported into the React components.  
This approach allows easy updates to products without changing application logic.

Example structure:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Product Name",
  "description": "Product description"
}
```

📧 Contact Form

The contact form is implemented using EmailJS.

Functionality:

Users enter their name, email, and message

The message is sent using EmailJS

The email is received in a test email account

⚠️ Note: EmailJS credentials are used for testing purposes only. In production, environment variables should be used to secure keys.
